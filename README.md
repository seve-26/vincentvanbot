- `Pillow` for image preprocessing
- Google Vision API for image labeling
- `NearestNeighbors` (with Minkowski distance) from `scikit-learn` for image similarity
- `FastAPI` for building API
- `streamlit` and `uvicorn` to build and run web app
- `Docker` and Google Compute Engine for hosting API, web app and Telegram bot
